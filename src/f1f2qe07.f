      SUBROUTINE F1F2QE07(Z, A, qsq, wsq, F1, F2) 
c
C Calculates quasielastic A(e,e')X structure functions F1 and F2 PER NUCLEUS
c for A>2 uses superscaling from Sick, Donnelly, Maieron, nucl-th/0109032
c for A=2 uses pre-integrated Paris wave function (see ~bosted/smear.f)
c coded by P. Bosted August to October, 2006
c
c input: Z, A  (real*8) Z and A of nucleus (shoud be 2.0D0 for deueron)
c        Qsq (real*8) is 4-vector momentum transfer squared (positive in
c                     chosen metric)
c        Wsq (real*8) is invarinat mass squared of final state calculated
c                     assuming electron scattered from a free proton
c                 
c outputs: F1, F2 (real*8) are structure functions per nucleus
c
c Note: Deuteron agrees well with Laget (see ~bosted/eg1b/laget.f) for
c a) Q2<1 gev**2 and dsig > 1% of peak: doesnt describe tail at high W
c b) Q2>1 gev**2 on wings of q.e. peak. But, this model is up
c    to 50% too big at top of q.e. peak. BUT, F2 DOES agree very
c    nicely with Osipenko et al data from CLAS, up to 5 GeV**2
